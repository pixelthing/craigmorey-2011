<p>Field days was a tiny site that no-longer exists. Why include it in a portfolio? Because it shows adaptability. Field days was built on the Actinic eCommerce system that I'd grappled with in the earliest Powertraveller website. I'd already found that it wasn't much to my taste, but I couldn't resist the challenge of seeing if you could actually get a good looking site out of the nasty "nested table" template system.</p>

<p>I still think I did alright.</p>
