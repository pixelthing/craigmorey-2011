After a sixth month run, the company that ran the (many) Lord of the Dance Troupes left London and moved all operations to - wait for it - Las Vegas. And that was the end of my website." /></a>

<p>Yes, I worked with a good colleague on the Michael Flatley Lord of the Dance website. It had already become a clich√© that when any client describes their ideal website, they use the word "clean". Well, this was the antidote to that. It was showbiz. </p>

<p>Designing with more glows, Celtic looking fonts and bright colours than I had ever done before, I was tasked with not only designing the front end to a CMS, but also skinning a PHPBB forum to look the same. Anyone who's tried to meddle with PHPBB templates knows the pain I went through, but getting the whole job feeling like the entertainment experience it should be was worth it.</p>
